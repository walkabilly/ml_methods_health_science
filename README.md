# CHEP 898: Machine Learning Methods in Health Science

## Course Syllabus

**Code**:	CHEP 898	

**Term**:	2026 Winter

**Delivery**:	In person

**Location**: 	HLTH	2334

**Start Date**:	January 6th, 2025

**Time**:	Tuesday 1:00- 3:50 pm

## Course Description
This course bridges the gap between data science techniques, biostatistics, and health research, equipping students with advanced tools to analyze complex health data. The course covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning. Through hands-on experience with R programming language, supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, and data visualization, students will learn to process and interpret large datasets to uncover insights into disease patterns, public health trends, and causal relationships. The course is designed to provide students with the theoretical knowledge and practical application of data science techniques. This will prepare learners to tackle health science challenges with modern data-driven approaches.

## Land Acknowledgement
I acknowledge our shared connection to the land and recognize that Indigenous and Métis peoples on Treaty 6 Territory and all Indigenous peoples have been and continue to be stewards for social justice, equity, and land-based education. In the spirit of reconciliation may we all strive to learn and support the work of Indigenous communities as allies. 

## Artificial Intelligence 
This course will follow the general USask Guidelines about AI for Educators and Students (https://leadership.usask.ca/initiatives/ai/index.php). The University has developed high level guidance based on the [European Network for Academic Integrity (ENAI) recommendations](https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00133-4). The principles are descriptions of USask intentions for, and beliefs about, the use of AI. They include 4 categories:
    * Ethical and Responsible Use
    * Literacy
    * Tool Use
    * Change and Innovation

### AI Rules for this course
In general, my opinion is that you should exploring these tools, what they can do, and how you can integrate them into your work. These tools are great for editing, formatting, generating ideas, and writing very basic code. USask faculty and students have access to Microsoft Co-Pilot (https://teaching.usask.ca/learning-technology/tools/microsoft-copilot.php). It's critical that when you use these tools you are very aware of bias and that you intervene to correct the text. Here are my general rules for AI in this course.

1. You can use AI tools for any or all parts of the work.

2. If you do you must cite your work (as above).
  
    2.1. Acknowledge AI tools: “All persons, sources, and tools that influence the ideas or generate the content should be properly acknowledged” (p. 3). Acknowledgement may be done in different ways, according to context and discipline, and should include the input to the tool.
    
    2.2. Do not list AI tools as authors: Authors must take responsibility and be accountable for content and an AI tool cannot do so.
    
    2.3. Recognize limits and biases of AI tools: Inaccuracies, errors, and bias are reproduced in AI tools in part because of the human produced materials used for training.

3. If you do you must include a 200 word reflective essay about the experience as part of your self-evaluation.

4. Be very careful with reference. Many of these tools just make up random references.

5. I will not use tools like [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/faq#i-m-an-educator-who-has-f) to detect whether you have used AI tools or not. We are making an agreement to be honest with each other here. This is small class. We have that luxury.

### Other Required Materials

Use of a statistical software program (R) is required for this course. You will also be asked to install other software including PostGRES (SQL) and Git. 

## Dataset

In this course we will use the [CanPath Student Dataset](https://canpath.ca/student-dataset/)  that provides students the unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience working with CanPath data. The CanPath Student Dataset is a synthetic dataset that was manipulated to mimic CanPath’s nationally harmonized data but does not include or reveal actual data of any CanPath participants.

The CanPath Student Dataset is available to instructors at a Canadian university or college for use in an academic course, at no cost. CanPath will provide the Student Dataset and a supporting data dictionary.

* Large sample size (Over 40,000 participants)
* Real-world population-level Canadian data
* Variety of areas of information allowing for a wide range of research topics
* No cost to faculty
* Potential for students to apply for real CanPath data to publish their findings
